                <h2>What is compound interest?</h2>
                <p>Compound interest is the interest on a loan or deposit that is calculated based on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Essentially, it means earning “interest on interest,” which can significantly increase the amount of interest earned or paid over time. This is a fundamental concept in finance and investing.</p>
                <p>Compound interest is a powerful tool in finance, helping investors grow their wealth over time and affecting how much borrowers pay on loans. Understanding how it works is essential for making informed financial decisions.</p>

            <section id="section3" class="formula">
                <h2>Compound interest formula</h2>
                <p>The compound interest formula is used to calculate the amount of interest earned on an investment or paid on a loan when interest is compounded over multiple periods. The formula considers the initial principal, the interest rate, the number of times interest is compounded per period, and the total number of periods.</p>

                        <li><span class="bold">P</span> = the principal investment/loan amount (the initial amount of money)</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">r</span> = the annual interest rate (in decimal form, so 5% becomes 0.05)</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">n</span> = the number of times interest is compounded per year</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">t</span> = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for</li>

                </div>
                <p>Understanding the compound interest formula is crucial for making informed decisions about investments, savings, and loans, as it highlights how different variables affect the future value of money.</p>

                <h2>What is rule of 4%?</h2>
                <p>The 4% rule is a guideline used in retirement planning to estimate a sustainable withdrawal rate from a retirement portfolio. It suggests that retirees can withdraw 4% of their retirement savings in the first year of retirement and adjust that amount for inflation each subsequent year without running out of money over a 30-year retirement period.</p>
