                <h2>Calculators for loan types</h2>
                    <p>Here are some details about the most common types of loans and the loan calculators that can help you in the process.</p>
                    <h4>Mortgage</h4>
                    <p>A mortgage loan is a type of loan used to purchase real estate, where the property serves as collateral. It involves borrowing a principal amount that accrues interest over a specified term, typically 15 to 30 years. Borrowers make an initial down payment and then repay the loan through monthly installments. Common types of mortgage loans include fixed-rate mortgages, where the interest rate remains constant, and adjustable-rate mortgages, where the interest rate can change. Specialized loans such as FHA loans, designed for low-to-moderate-income borrowers, VA loans for military veterans, and jumbo loans for amounts exceeding conforming limits, offer various benefits and requirements.</p>

            <section id="section2" class="Auto Loan">
                <h2>Auto Loan</h2>
                <p>An auto loan is a type of financing provided by banks, credit unions, or car dealerships to help individuals purchase a vehicle. The loan amount covers the cost of the car, minus any down payment made by the borrower. The borrower then repays the loan in monthly installments over a fixed term, usually ranging from 36 to 72 months, with interest applied. The vehicle itself serves as collateral, meaning if the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender can repossess the car. Auto loans can have fixed or variable interest rates, and the terms and rates are influenced by factors such as the borrower’s credit score, income, and the loan amount.</p>

            <section id="section3" class="Student Loan">
                <h2>Student Loan</h2>
                <p>A student loan is a type of financial aid designed to help students cover the cost of higher education, including tuition, books, and living expenses. These loans can be provided by the federal government or private lenders. Federal student loans often have lower interest rates and more flexible repayment options compared to private loans, and they may include benefits like income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness programs. Repayment typically begins after a grace period following graduation or when the student drops below half-time enrollment. Interest on student loans can be fixed or variable, and the eligibility and terms depend on factors such as the borrower’s financial need, credit history, and the type of loan.</p>

                <h2>How to calculate</h2>
                <p>Calculating a loan typically involves understanding the principal amount, interest rate, and loan term. Here’s a basic overview of how to calculate the monthly payment for a loan using the loan amortization formula:
