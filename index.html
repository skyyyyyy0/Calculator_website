                    <h2>How to use</h2>
                    <p>The Compound Interest Calculator helps you determine the future value of an investment based on
                        the
                        initial principal, the number of periods, and the rate of return. Follow the steps below to use
                        the
                        calculator:</p>
                    <ul class="how_to_order">
                        <li><span class="bold">Initial Value ($)</span> : Enter the initial amount of money you are
                            investing. For example, if you are starting with $100,000, input 100000 in this field.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Number of Times (Period)</span> : Enter the number of periods for which
                            the
                            investment will grow. For instance, if you plan to invest for 5 years, input 5 in this
                            field.
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Rate of Return (%)</span> : Input the annual rate of return as a
                            percentage.
                            For example, if you expect a 5% return per year, input 5 in this field.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Calculate</span> : Click the green Calculate button to compute the
                            compound
                            interest. The calculator will process the inputs and display the results.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Result ($)</span> : The Result field will show the final amount of your
                            investment after the specified number of periods and the given rate of return. This value is
                            automatically updated when you click Calculate.</li>

                    <h2>What is compound interest?</h2>
                    <p>Compound interest is the interest on a loan or deposit that is calculated based on both the
                        initial
                        principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Essentially, it means earning
                        “interest on interest,” which can significantly increase the amount of interest earned or paid
                        over
                        time. This is a fundamental concept in finance and investing.</p>
                    <p>Compound interest is a powerful tool in finance, helping investors grow their wealth over time
                        and
                        affecting how much borrowers pay on loans. Understanding how it works is essential for making
                        informed financial decisions.</p>

                    <h2>Compound interest formula</h2>
                    <p>The compound interest formula is used to calculate the amount of interest earned on an investment
                        or
                        paid on a loan when interest is compounded over multiple periods. The formula considers the
                        initial
                        principal, the interest rate, the number of times interest is compounded per period, and the
                        total

                        from
                        a retirement portfolio. It suggests that retirees can withdraw 4% of their retirement savings in
                        the
                        first year of retirement and adjust that amount for inflation each subsequent year without
                        running

                        some
                        common use cases:</p>
